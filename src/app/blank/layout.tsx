// MainLayout component is likely a higher-level component that defines the main structure of the application's layout, such as the header, footer, and any other common elements that should be present on every page.
import { MainLayout } from 'src/layouts/main';

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
// The provided code defines a simple React component called Layout that serves as a wrapper for the MainLayout component. This is a common pattern in React applications to manage the overall structure and layout of the application.

// The Props type specifies that the Layout component expects a single prop called children, which is of type React.ReactNode. This type is a flexible type that can represent any valid React element, including strings, numbers, arrays, fragments, and other components. Essentially, it allows the Layout component to wrap any content passed to it.
type Props = {
  children: React.ReactNode;
};

// The Layout component itself is defined as a functional component:
// Function Definition: The component is defined as a default export, meaning it can be imported without specifying a named import. It takes a single argument, children, which is destructured from the Props object.
export default function Layout({ children }: Props) {

  // Return Statement: The component returns the MainLayout component, passing the children prop as its children. This means that any content wrapped by the Layout component will be rendered inside the MainLayout component.
  return <MainLayout>{children}</MainLayout>;
}

// In summary, the Layout component is a simple wrapper that uses the MainLayout component to provide a consistent layout structure for the application. By defining the Props type, the code ensures type safety and clarity about what props the component expects. This pattern is useful for maintaining a consistent layout across different pages of a React application, making it easier to manage and update the overall structure of the application.
