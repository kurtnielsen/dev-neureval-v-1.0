// The first import statement brings in a CONFIG object from a global configuration file located at src/config-global. This CONFIG object likely contains various configuration settings for the application, such as the application name, API keys, and other environment-specific settings.
import { CONFIG } from 'src/config-global';

// The second import statement imports the SupabaseSignInView component from src/auth/view/supabase. This component is responsible for rendering the sign-in view for users who need to authenticate using Supabase.
import { SupabaseSignInView } from 'src/auth/view/supabase';

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
// The provided code defines a React component for a sign-in page using Supabase, a popular backend-as-a-service platform. This component is part of a larger project that utilizes Node.js, npm, React, and TypeScript.

// This metadata object contains a title property, which is set to a string that includes the application name from the CONFIG object. The title is dynamically constructed using template literals, resulting in a string like "Sign in | Supabase - [AppName]". This title is likely used to set the document title for the sign-in page, providing a better user experience and improving SEO.
export const metadata = { title: `Sign in | Supabase - ${CONFIG.appName}` };

// The Page component is a functional React component that serves as the default export of the module. When this component is rendered, it returns the SupabaseSignInView component.
export default function Page() {

  // The SupabaseSignInView component is responsible for displaying the sign-in interface, allowing users to authenticate using Supabase. By encapsulating this view within the Page component, the code maintains a clear separation of concerns and makes it easier to manage different views and routes within the application.
  return <SupabaseSignInView />;
}

// In summary, the provided code defines a React component for a Supabase sign-in page. It imports necessary configuration and view components, sets up metadata for the page title, and renders the SupabaseSignInView component. This approach ensures that the sign-in page is well-integrated with the application's overall configuration and provides a consistent user experience. The use of TypeScript helps in maintaining type safety and improving code quality throughout the project.
