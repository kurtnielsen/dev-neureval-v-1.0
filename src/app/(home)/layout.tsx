import { MainLayout } from 'src/layouts/main';

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
// The provided code defines a simple layout component for a React application using TypeScript. This component is designed to wrap its children with a main layout structure, ensuring a consistent look and feel across different parts of the application. Let's break down the code step by step.

type Props = {
  children: React.ReactNode;
};

export default function Layout({ children }: Props) {
  return <MainLayout>{children}</MainLayout>;
}

// The MainLayout component is used to provide a consistent layout structure for the application. By wrapping the children prop with MainLayout, the Layout component ensures that any content passed to it will be displayed within the context of the main layout.
// In summary, the provided code defines a Layout component that wraps its children with a MainLayout component. This approach helps maintain a consistent layout and styling across different parts of the application. The use of TypeScript for defining the props type ensures type safety and improves the developer experience. By encapsulating the main layout logic within the MainLayout component, the code promotes reusability and separation of concerns, making the application easier to manage and extend.
