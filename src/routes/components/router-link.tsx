import RouterLink from 'next/link';

export { RouterLink };
// The RouterLink component is used to create links between different pages in a Next.js application, enabling client-side navigation without a full page reload.

// In summary, the code snippet imports the RouterLink component from the next/link package and re-exports it. This practice simplifies import statements, encapsulates third-party dependencies, and ensures consistency across your project. By centralizing the import of RouterLink, you make your codebase cleaner and easier to maintain. This approach is particularly beneficial in larger projects where multiple modules and components are involved.
