// The provided code snippet defines three TypeScript type aliases that are essential for managing authentication state in a React project. These types help ensure that the authentication-related data structures are consistent and type-safe throughout the application.

// The UserType type alias represents a user object. It is defined as either a Record<string, any> or null.
// Record<string, any> is a TypeScript utility type that represents an object with string keys and values of any type. This allows for flexibility in defining user objects with various properties.
// The null type is included to represent the absence of a user, which is useful for scenarios where no user is logged in.
export type UserType = Record<string, any> | null;

// The AuthState type alias represents the state of authentication in the application.
// It includes two properties:
// user: This property is of type UserType, representing the current user or null if no user is logged in.
// loading: This boolean property indicates whether the authentication process is currently in progress. It is useful for showing loading indicators while the application checks the user's authentication status.
export type AuthState = {
  user: UserType;
  loading: boolean;
};
// The AuthContextValue type alias represents the value provided by an authentication context in a React application.
// It includes the following properties:
// user: This property is of type UserType, representing the current user or null if no user is logged in.
// loading: This boolean property indicates whether the authentication process is currently in progress.
// authenticated: This boolean property indicates whether the user is authenticated.
// unauthenticated: This boolean property indicates whether the user is unauthenticated.
// checkUserSession?: This optional property is a function that returns a Promise<void>. It is used to check the user's session, typically by making an API call to verify the user's authentication status.
export type AuthContextValue = {
  user: UserType;
  loading: boolean;
  authenticated: boolean;
  unauthenticated: boolean;
  checkUserSession?: () => Promise<void>;
};

// In summary, these type aliases define the structure of authentication-related data in a React project using TypeScript. UserType represents the user object, AuthState represents the authentication state, and AuthContextValue represents the value provided by an authentication context. These types ensure that the authentication data structures are consistent and type-safe, making the codebase easier to maintain and less prone to errors.
