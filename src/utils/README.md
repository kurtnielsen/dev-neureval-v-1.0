# Step 1: Review the Axios Setup

## Why This Is Important: Axios is likely the core utility being used for making HTTP requests across your app. It’s critical to understand

How base URLs are defined.
Whether request interceptors are used (e.g., adding authorization headers for Supabase tokens).
Any custom configurations (e.g., timeouts, retry logic).
What to Look For:

Base URL: Does Axios define a base URL? This is important to determine whether API routes are appended to a common root (like your server URL or Supabase endpoint).
Interceptors: Check if any request or response interceptors are used to modify requests automatically (e.g., adding auth tokens) or globally handle responses (e.g., centralized error handling).
Headers: Verify whether Axios is setting up default headers (such as Authorization, Content-Type, etc.).
Instance or Global Config: Is Axios being instantiated as a custom instance (axios.create()), or are requests using the default global instance? This impacts how the config is applied across the app.
Error Handling: Look for how errors are managed—if Axios globally handles responses and errors (via interceptors) or if there’s a utility wrapping Axios calls.
Key Axios-Related Files:
axios.ts: The main Axios configuration file you uploaded.
fetcher.ts or utils.ts (if available): Sometimes there are additional utility files that define how Axios interacts with SWR or other fetching logic.
Any interceptors or middleware setup (if available): Could be helpful to see if Axios intercepts requests/responses.

### authentication and Axios interceptors

  1. Configure Axios Interceptors:

- We’ll inject authentication tokens (Supabase or others) into requests via interceptors.
- Ensure the Axios instance handles API requests and responses with authentication headers.

  2. Update Axios Routes:

  - Once Axios is configured for secure requests, we’ll wire the API routes to Drizzle ORM to fetch and manage post data from Supabase.

## 2. Review Key Utilities

Several utility files you uploaded will likely play a role in how the app manages data fetching, formatting, and logging:

response.ts: Likely contains utilities for handling API responses and standardizing status codes, errors, etc.
helper.ts: This may have helper functions for various operations, potentially including request formatting.
logger.ts: Useful for logging Axios errors and responses for debugging.
format-number.ts, format-time.ts: Utilities to handle data formatting for time and numbers.
change-case.ts: Helper for case conversions (used in API responses).
with-loading-props.tsx: This might provide a HOC or utility for adding loading states to components.
storage-available.ts and uuidv4.ts: Likely handle storage and unique IDs, which may be needed for request IDs or session management.
